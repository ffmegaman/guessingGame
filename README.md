#Guessing Game!

####Guess the foreign country that I have been to.

1. An array to store the countries I have been to
2. Prompt user for guess
3. Compare user's guess to items in array for a match

####Additional Features:
- The game loops until the user gets all the countries correctly or until user cancels.
- Game keeps track of correct guesses and informs the user of his/her previous guesses.
