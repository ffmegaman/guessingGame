#Guessing Game!

####Guess the foreign country that I have been to.

1. An array to store the countries I have been to
2. Prompt user for guess
3. Compare user's guess to items in array for a match

####Additional Features:
- The game loops until the user gets all the countries correctly or until user cancels.
- Game keeps track of correct guesses and informs the user of his/her previous guesses.

####Thanks to the following people for helping me unstuck myself:
- Vincent
- Brook

#Guessing Game v.2

This was an in-class collaboration with Sam Hamm (who is authoring this part of this README file, and did all of the tying on this project).

We made the following changes:

1. Changed multiple uses of *.length into variables: numAnswer, numCorrect.
2. Corrected an issue with the presentation of the congratulations window.
3. The change from the .length to the variables creaded a need to increment the variables.
4. We made a few enhancements to readability/formatting.

Overall it was a positive collaborative experience.
